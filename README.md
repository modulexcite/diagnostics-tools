My diagnostics tools
====================

It is a repository of small tools which might help you diagnose .NET and Windows applications. Some tools are still available on the old [Codeplex page](http://diagnettoolkit.codeplex.com/).

Following tools have been published:

## Database diagnostics ##

### [Bazik (2.0)](https://github.com/lowleveldesign/dotnet-tools/releases/tag/bazik) ###

It's a web application that monitors SQL Server - some screenshots and information can be found on my blog: <https://lowleveldesign.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/bazik-sql-server-monitoring-application/>. Some improvements were made since then.
